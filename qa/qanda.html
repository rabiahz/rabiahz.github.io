Over the years, my work as a designer at Mason Gross<br>
    has evolved to a great extent and is mainly influenced by issues and daily struggles<br> that concern me and also taking inspirations from the environment around me. I <br>also feel as if I have grown as a designer over the past year as I willingly try and make<br> work that is distinct and simple for it to be able to get my ideas and objectives across.<br>
<p class="linepara">Working around with images and text, I have grown to simplify my art that portrays <br>its function through its forms using images and text together in books, posters, websites,<br> etc. involving other mediums in my work like print, paint, collage and photography. This <br>has also become one of my strengths as I start mixing different media together in my <br>works becoming interested in textures, color choices and layering of elements together<br> while also being minimalistic in the choices I make. I also feel like I have gained <br>confidence in the way I use type and image together such as in my books and some of <br> my posters. Along the way, I have taken inspirations from different artists like El Anatsui <br>for the way he uses colors in his sculpture collages, and textures he achieves and <br>Alvin Lustig’s compositions with his well-balanced use of text and graphics together.<br> Taking a print class has also helped me influence and improve my color, composition and <br>design choices and has made me switch back and forth between both mediums. 
    <p class="linepara">
For thesis, I have not really narrowed it down, but I am interested in making more books <br> layering other mediums like photography and print or redesigning a site or place that<br> reminds me of home – the culture and place I was brought up in.
